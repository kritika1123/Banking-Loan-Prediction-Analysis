Launched an intensive data quality initiative that systematically eliminated 2,500 outliers and rectified 1,200 missing values; the enhancements in data accuracy resulted in improved forecasting reliability and better-informed decision-making across
departments. Designed a suite of 20 customized pivot tables that enhanced data visualization capabilities, strengthened reporting accuracy by 40% and facilitated quicker turnaround for key stakeholder insights during quarterly reviews. Created more than 15 visualizations, uncovering a 25% increase in default rates with extended terms and identifying 15% of high
interest loans contributing to defaults. Recommended and implemented revised loan policies, reducing defaults by 12% and improving data quality and strategic decision-making.
